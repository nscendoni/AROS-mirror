This is *not* a complete TODO list (which would be far too long and
depressing), but what I think is a minimal set of features that *must* be
done before the new site goes public.

+ Finish the following scripts:

  - Status (jobs and size)

+ Generated HTML that does not require CSS support to be displayed correctly.

  Currently, the default docutils HTML writer is used which requires HTML
  4 (actually XHTML 1, but it should be compatible) and CSS. The surrounding
  template doesn't require CSS, but the actual document contents do. Requiring
  CSS might anger some of the Amiga community, so...

  There are two options for implementing this: either the formatting system is
  rewritten to use the docutils XML writer and XSLT to transform it into some
  HTML document (which I think Daniel is a fan of) or code a new docutils
  writer. The latter should not be *that* hard; just take the existing HTML
  writer and replace bits... The advantages of coding a new writer is that we
  don't add any more dependencies (ie. a XSLT processing tool). Hard to say
  which would be fastest to implement...

+ Write an explanation of the license and what it entails. Integrate the
  license page better with the rest of the site.

The following are some random bits that would be *nice* to have when the site
goes public, but are IMHO not *necessary*:

+ Document the documentation system in documentation/developers/documenting.en
+ At least a demonstration of the multilingual support. For exampla translated
  introduction/index to a couple of languages.
+ Better build system (not the ad-hoc thing it is now)
+ Support for different languages.
+ Some files/scripts have to be manually updated when a new year
  begins => automation
+ The script buildit.py has hardcoded paths to pictures => use pattern
