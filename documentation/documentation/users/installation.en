            updating to the current status.
:Abstract:
    This manual will guide you through the necessary steps for installing
    different AROS flavours.

    .. Warning::

        AROS is alpha quality software. This means that it is currently mostly
        fun to play with and cool to develop for. If you came here because you
        thought AROS was a finished, complete and fully usable operating
        system, you will most likely be disappointed. AROS isn't there yet,
        but we're slowly moving in the right direction.


.. Contents::

Downloading
===========

As AROS is currently under heavy development, no new stable snapshots are
currently available. The snapshots that are still available are obsolete and
don't reflect the current status of AROS. The users are encouraged to
download the nightly builds instead.

Nightly builds are done, as the name implies, automatically every night
directly from the Subversion tree and contain the latest code. However, they
have not been tested in any way and can be horribly broken, extremely buggy
and should you be very unlucky, they might even destroy your system. Most of
the time they work fine, though.

Please see the `download page`_ for more information on nightly builds
available and how to download them.






Installation
============

AROS/linux-i386, AROS/linux-x86-64 and AROS/freebsd-i386
--------------------------------------------------------

Requirements
""""""""""""

To run AROS/linux-i386, AROS/linux-x86-64 or AROS/freebsd-i386 you will need
the following:

+ A working FreeBSD 5.x or Linux installation (doesn't really matter which
  distribution you run, as long as it's relatively recent).
+ A configured and working X server (for example X.Org or XFree86) for
  x11.hidd, or libsdl installed (for sdl.hidd).

That's it.




Extracting
""""""""""

Since AROS/linux-i386, AROS/linux-x86-64 and AROS/freebsd-i386 are hosted
flavors of AROS, installation is simple. Simply get the appropriate archives
for your platform from the `download page`_ and extract them where you want
them::

    > tar -vxjf AROS-<version>-<platform>-<cpu>-system.tar.bz2

If you downloaded the contrib archive, you may want to extract it too (but
its contents is already included in the system archive and on the LiveCD)::

    > tar -vxjf AROS-<version>-pc-<cpu>-contrib.tar.bz2




Running
"""""""

After having extracted all files you can launch AROS like this::

    > cd AROS
    > boot/aros-unix -m <size of mem, used for AROS in MB, number>


.. Note::

    Unless you are running XFree86 3.x or earlier, you may notice that the
    AROS window does not refresh properly (for example when a different window
    passes over it). This is due to the fact that AROS uses the "backingstore"
    functionality of X, which is turned off by default in XFree86 4.0 and
    later.
    To turn it on, add the following line to the device section of your
    graphics card in the X configuration file (commonly named
    ``/etc/X11/xorg.conf``, ``/etc/X11/XF86Config-4`` or
    ``/etc/X11/XF86Config``)::

        Option "backingstore"

    A complete device section might then look like this::

        Section "Device"
            Identifier      "Matrox G450"
            Driver          "mga"
            BusID           "PCI:1:0:0"
            Option          "backingstore"
        EndSection

Also there's an sdl.hidd, allowing you to run AROS-Hosted without any X-server
ever installed. It's known to be working, but is in testing stage.





AROS/pc-i386 and AROS/pc-X86-64
-------------------------------

Requirements
""""""""""""

.. Note::

    AROS can be installed to a hard drive, and its installer won't remove or
    wipe any partitions if not asked to do so. However, note that it's always
    unwise to install an operating system on a working machine whose HD
    contains valuable data. We'd advise you to make a backup of your data
    beforehand (always a good thing to do), and we cannot take responsibility
    for damage that occurs. Any bug reports on the installation  process will
    however be appreciated.

You will need a *PCI-based* PC-AT (based on i486 or later) with PS/2
or USB mouse, PS/2, AT or USB keyboard, IDE hard disk and CD-ROM on parallel
ATA or SATA configured in legacy mode, and an (S)VGA video card and monitor.
At least 24 MB of RAM is required. A VESA-compliant VGA card is recommended.
There are generic 2D-accelerated drivers (HIDDs) for some ATI and nVidia
cards.

Also, most PC-compatible emulators/VMs (virtual machines) can be used. QEMU,
VMware (Server/Workstation/Fusion), Q, Bochs and MS VPC are known to work.
A notable exception is VirtualBox.
IcAros is a distribution already configured with Qemu (windows)

AROS has drivers for several different network cards.
Further details are available in the FAQ.

If you want to try sound on AROS, the best choice at this moment is
Creative 10k-based sound cards.

The x86-64 port has similar requirements, except of course that
a 64-bit capable Intel/AMD CPU is needed. Chipset support is currently
limited. This port is in the early stages of development, so please report
any bugs found.




BIOS Settings
"""""""""""""

AROS relies on the BIOS to do some hardware configuration that other
operating systems handle by themselves. Because of this, the BIOS
settings are more important when using AROS. Listed below are some of
the common BIOS options that affect AROS, and advice on how to set them.

+ **Plug 'n' Play OS:** If it exists, choose the option for a
  **non**-plug-'n'-play OS.

+ **Bus mastering:** If there's an option to enable or disable PCI bus
  mastering, it must be enabled.

+ **ATA mode:** In most cases, you should set the transfer mode for every
  disk drive to the best mode possible. Only set a slower mode if you have
  trouble with disk access in AROS.

+ **SATA mode:** On some computers with SATA disk drives, you may need to
  select a legacy/compatibility mode for disk access.

In most cases, the BIOS options selected for AROS will also be
compatible with other OSs on your computer. However, changing the SATA
mode may require you to change some settings in these other OSs or even
reinstall them.



Installation media
""""""""""""""""""

The recommended installation media for AROS/pc-i386 is CD-ROM, since the whole
system fits on a single disc (and also all the contributed software).
This also makes the installation easier, since you don't have to go through
hoops transferring the software on several floppies.

Since nobody currently sells AROS on CAROM (or any other media for that
matter), you will need access to a CD burner to create the installation disk
yourself.



CD-ROM
^^^^^^

Writing
'''''''

Simply download the ISO image from the `download page`_ (we recommend
using a download manager able to resume broken downloads, like wget)
and burn it to the CD using your favorite CD burning program. There are
a number of freeware CD burning programs for any system. Windows users we can
point to the `InfraRecorder
<http://infrarecorder.sourceforge.net>`__ - it's free, small and fast,
and it's just simple. Other examples are CDBurnerXP, DeepBurn, and AstroBurn.
In the Linux world there are k3B, Brasero and others. On Amiga (and AROS) you
can use FryingPan.


Booting
'''''''

The easiest way to boot from the AROS installation CD is if you have a
computer that supports booting from CD-ROM. This might require additional
changes in the BIOS set-up, though, to enable booting from CD-ROM, as it is
quite often disabled by default.
Once the computer is set to boot from CD-ROM, simply insert the CD into the
first CD-ROM drive and reboot the computer. The boot is fully automatic, and
if everything works you should see a nice screen after a little while.

If your computer does not support booting directly from CD-ROM, you can create
a boot floppy_ and use it together with the CD-ROM. Simply insert both the
boot floppy and the CD into their respective drives and reboot. AROS will
start booting from the floppy, but after the most important things have been
loaded (including the CD-ROM file system handler) it will continue booting
from the CD-ROM.



Floppy
^^^^^^

These days floppies can be found useful only to boot if your PC's BIOS
doesn't support booting from CD or on some really obsolete PCs. But it's
still maintained.


Writing
'''''''

To create the boot floppy, you will need to download the disk image from
the `download page`_, extract the archive, and write the boot image to a
floppy disk. If you are using a Unix-like operating system (such as Linux or
FreeBSD), you can do this with the following command::

    > cd AROS-<version>-pc-i386-boot-floppy
    > dd if=aros.bin of=/dev/fd0

If you are using Windows, you will need to get rawrite_ to write the image to
a floppy. Please see the documentation of rawrite_ for information on how to
use it. There's also an GUI version called rawwritewin.


Booting
'''''''

Simply insert the boot floppy into the drive and reboot the computer. The boot
is fully automatic, and if everything works you should see a nice screen after
a while.



Installing to hard drive
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Note that you have been WARNED that AROS is still in development. Though
harddisk installation is well-developed by now; there is still an off chance
that it may corrupt existing partitions. If you want to be as safe as possible,
install AROS on its own harddisk. Other options would be: Making a full backup
beforehand, using a PC which does not contain anything you can't live without,
or use a virtual machine.
There are many free VMs available, such as VirtualPC, Q, QEMU and VMWare, which
are known to work with AROS. You can also use VmwAROS preinstalled environment
to try it out. 


Getting ready
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, set up your HD - either real or a virtual drive image - for use.
For a real drive, this may involve plugging it into the machine (always
a good start) and setting it up in the BIOS. For a virtualiser's or
emulator's virtual drive, you probably just need to select an option to
create a new drive image, and set it as one of the virtual PC's boot
devices (the CD drive must be the first boot device during installation
of AROS however).

The following options are depending on what you want to do.



Installing AROS Only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The most simple situation is that of installing AROS alone on the whole disk,
either a new one or one with some unneeded data on it. You might also use an
additional HDD for AROS.

Currently the installation is meant to be made by means of the InstallAROS
program, which is located in the *Tools* drawer on your BootCD. Please, launch
it by clicking on its icon. Once it's launched, it'll show you the greeting
screen. Then click the ``Proceed`` button in the installer to get a screen
with installing options.

You can see the current installing device (ata.device) and its unit (0),
which is your first HDD. If you intend to install on additional disk, please,
change this number. To find out the number, you can use a */Tools/HDToolbox*
utility. Check the option ``Only use free space`` if you want to keep current
partitions as they are, or select ``Wipe disk`` to **erase** existing data on
the hard drive. You can set the size of new AROS partition if you wish, and
add an extra WORK partition to install programs on it. After you click
the ``Proceed`` button again, installAROS will create the partition or
partitions, and after that it will ask you to reboot. After the reboot, please
start InstallAROS again.

This time, the option ``Use existing AROS partitions`` should be selected.
``Proceed`` with this. You will see some extra options (defaults shown)
in a window::

    [ ] Choose language Options
    [x] Install AROS Core System
    [x] Install Extra Software
    [ ] Install Development Software
    [x] Install Bootloader

+ ``Choose language Options`` allows you to select the locale of your newly
    installed system (by launching the /Extras/Locale program).
+ ``Install AROS Core System`` allows installing of all AROS base programs
    that the OS needs to function properly.
+ ``Install Extra Software`` allows installing additional programs (located
    in the /Extras drawer and, if selected, on the WORK partition).
+ ``Install Development Software`` allows the installation of development
    software, like programming languages.
+ ``Install Bootloader`` enables installing of GRUB bootloader to the MBR of
    HD. (There can be some situations where you don't need to install this.)

Make your choice and click the ``Proceed`` button.

On the next installer screen you can choose which partitions you want to
format and copy files to, and whether a WORK partition is used and whether
files should be copied to it::

    Destination Partition     [x] Format Partition
    DH0

    [ ] Use 'WORK' Partition
    [ ] Copy Extras and Development Files to Work

    Work Partition            [ ] Format Partition
    DH1


After you made your choices and proceed, the installer will show the GRUB
installation device and the path to the GRUB files for you to check.
Proceeding, you will see the last screen before installation, which will warn
you about the pre-alpha status of the AROS install process. After clicking
``Proceed`` one last time, you should see the installer doing its work.
You may be asked to select your keyboard type and locale settings, then the
files are being copied. This may take a while; be patient, please.

After the installation is finished, you can remove the AROS Live CD from the
CD-ROM drive and reboot into your newly-installed AROS system.



Installing AROS along with Windows(R)/DOS(R)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing AROS along with Windows should be an easy task (assuming you use
Windows XP). Generally, you'll just need to follow the installer prompts as
shown above to make this working. The installer is designed to automatically
detect your Windows installation and put it in the GRUB menu. Check the
chapter above about standalone AROS installation for the details of the
procedure.

If you ever need to restore the previous NT loader, you can use the ``fixmbr``
command in the recovery console from your Windows installation CD.


There can be problems with some older and newer Windows versions (like 95/98
and Vista).  For installing over Vista you can use steps, similar to the ones
for Linux with GRUB installer. In cases where Grub should be installed and
used to boot Vista, you'd just need to add a menu entry to your
/boot/grub/menu.lst::

    title Windows Vista
    root (hd0,0)
    makeactive
    chainloader +1

If you prefer to use the Vista bootloader, there are programs like EasyBCD to
manage its behaviour.

Installing AROS along with Linux/BSD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing AROS along with Linux or BSD systems is almost the same as doing so
for Windows. You'll need to create free space for AROS with available tools.
Then use InstallAROS to do the partitioning and formatting of the AROS
partition and copy the system on to it. (You can use additional WORK partition
if you want to.) It's better, however, not to install the bootloader
(uncheck the corresponding checkbox)::

    [ ] Install Bootloader

After the installer has finished copying the files, it will ask you to reboot.
After the reboot you'll need to boot your Linux/BSD again, to set up the
bootloader.
AROS uses a patched GRUB bootloader, able to load a kernel from AFFS. But you
don't have to use it, if you put AROS kernel in the location of your system
kernel is - usually /boot - and use a conventional GRUB from your
distribution. Just copy ``/boot/aros-i386.gz`` from AROS LiveCD to ``/boot``.
Then put some new lines to the end of your ``/boot/grub/menu.lst`` file to
include an AROS menu entry::

    title AROS VBE  640x480  16bpp
    root (hd0,0)
    kernel /boot/aros-pc-i386.gz vesa=640x480x16 ATA=32bit floppy=disabled
    quiet
    boot

You can change the kernel's parameters to set the screen resolution. The
'floppy=disabled' option disables the floppy trackdisk device, as this device
is not too useful these days but can cause troubles in some cases.

If you happen to use lilo or any other booloader, this trick won't be that
easy. (It's hard to make lilo booting AROS kernel.) You will need to somehow
chainload AROS GRUB and set it to start up a kernel.

After the reboot, you should be able to see an AROS entry in the GRUB menu and
to boot AROS.



Installing AROS along with other systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A lot of other operating systems exist on the platforms AROS supports. If your
system uses GRUB bootloader the process should be fairly similar to the one
for Linux. If not, please remember that all you need for AROS to boot is just
to place its files on a partition where GRUB can find it and boot the kernel.

Manual install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*(almost deprecated)*  Using InstallAROS is recommended.

As the InstallAROS is functional now, the following information is kind of
deprecated but still can be of some interest, so it's been kept here for
informational purposes.

.. Note::
    Although AROS can be installed to a hard drive, please be aware that
    HDToolBox is known to contain bugs. It should not remove or wipe any
    partitions if not asked to do so, but this cannot be guaranteed.
    So please note that generally you **should not** install AROS on a
    working machine whose HD contains valuable data, as there is a real
    possibility of data loss. We take no responsibility for any
    data loss that occurs. Any bug reports on the installation
    process will, however, be appreciated.

**Partitioning**


*Single partition install*

This describes how to install AROS as the only system on a PC and install it
on a single partition. This is an easier installation example.

This chapter can be found a bit tricky, as the install feature is incomplete.
First, remember a *common rule* for this process - *reboot* after any
significant change made to the file system (we will note where it is
needed). Rebooting means closing the HDToolbox window if it's open and
restarting the computer or VM, so it's a hard reset. You can also try a soft
reset by typing <reboot> ENTER in CLI window.

First, find a tool on the AROS CD called *HDToolBox*. It's located in the
Tools drawer. This is your HD tormenter for a while. When you start it,
you will see a window with a device-type selector. In this example (here
and further on), we are using a real or virtual IDE hard drive (also
known as an ATA hard drive). So, clicking on the *ata.device* entry will
show Devices:1 in the left window. This is your HD. By clicking on
this entry, you'll enter the available HD list.

So here you should see your HD listed. If it's a virtual HD, you'll see
something like *QEMU Harddisk* or the equivalent VMWare one. If your HD is
real, you should see its name. If this doesn't happen, you must make
sure you've correctly prepared your HD. Clicking on the HD name will
give you some information::

    Size: <Size of HD>
    Partition Table: <type of current PT; must be unknown after cleanup>
    Partitions: <count of partitions on HD; must be 0 as you've just started>

Now, you should create a new partition table. IN this case, for a PC, you
should create a *PC-MBR* type of table. To do this, please press the *Create
Table* button and choose *PC-MBR* from the list. Click OK.

Then write the changes to disk. To do this, click on the HD's name and press
*Save Changes*. Answer *Yes* in the confirmation dialog. Close the HDToolbox
window and reboot the system from the Live CD.


After the system boots up, start HDToolbox again. Now, after entering the
*ata.device* entry you should see the info "Partition table: PC-MBR. You
should also see "Partitions:0", as you set no partitions yet.

To set the partitions, click on the HD's name to go to the partitions list.
The list is still empty. Click on *Create Entry* button, choose all the space,
by clicking on unselected empty space, and click *OK*. You should now see an
entry "Partition 0" in the list. Choose it by clicking, to get this
information::

    Size: <Partition size. Almost equal to HD size>
    Partition table: Unknown <Not created yet>
    Partition type: AROS RDB Partition table <A possibility>
    Active: No <Not active>
    Bootable: No <Not bootable>
    Automount: No <Will not mount on system startup>

A choice can be made here - Either making a partition in a RDB table, or in a
PC-MBR partition. RDB (Rigid Disk Block) is the choice of compatibility; it
was used in Amiga HDD's partitioning, and it can be used here too. Yet, AROS
also supports FFS partitions created within a common PC-MBR table, similar to
normal PC partitions like FAT/NTFS/etc., and this can be considered somewhat
more modern and more compatible to some new AROS programs. Here follow
paragraphs on both cases.

*FFS in RDB*
Click on the *Create Table* button, select *RDB table* and click OK. To save
changes, go *one level* up by clicking the *Parent* button, select the HD name
again and click the *Save Changes* button. Answer *Yes* in the confirmation
dialog twice. Exit from HDToolbox and reboot the machine.

*FFS in MBR*
...to be added

After booting up, start HDToolbox (again). The info for your Partition 0 has
not changed, except that the partition table should now be as you set it, RDB
or MBR. This partition must be set to Active. To do this, click on the
*Switches* button, select the *Active* checkbox and click *OK*. And again save
the changes by going a level up and clicking the button. Exit and reboot.

The reason you're told to reboot so often is that HDToolbox and the system
libraries it uses are still unfinished and quite buggy, and rebooting after
every step ensures they return to their initial state.

After boot up, HDToolbox should show you that Partition 0 has become active.
Once it is active, you should create your disk to install AROS on. Go
one level down by clicking on the "Partition 0" entry. Click the *Add Entry*
button and choose all the empty space. Now you should see see a "DH0" entry
there, which is your disk. Clicking on it shows information::

    Size: <well...>
    Partition Table: Unknown <don't worry about it>
    Partition Type: Fast Filesystem Intl <As intended>
    Active: No <Not active>
    Bootable: No <Not bootable>
    Automount: No <Will not mount on system startup>

Now, go *2 levels up* to the HD name, click Save Changes, confirm, exit
and reboot.

After booting up HDToolbox (again!), you should now set the switches to the
DH0 drive. Go to the DH0 entry and set switches with the relevant button and
check boxes: *Bootable: Yes* and *Automount: Yes*. Go 2 levels up, save
changes, confirm and reboot. You're more than half way now!

After starting up HDToolbox (once more), check the settings for DH0. They
should all be OK now. If so, you can exit HDToolbox with no hesitation. Now
it's time for some CLI magic.


**Formatting**

You need to format your created DH0 drive to make it usable. Currently, AROS
has a choice of two file systems - Fast FileSystem (FFS) and Smart FileSystem
(SFS).
FFS is known to be somewhat more stable and compatible to most programs,
while SFS is more fail-proof and advanced, but still has some issues with some
programs.

Currently you have to set it to FFS, because GRUB bootloader doesn't support
SFS. (GRUB2 will.) Also, please note that with SFS you can get problems using
some ported software, such as gcc. So, open the CLI window (right click on
upper menu and select Shell from the first Wanderer menu). At the prompt,
enter the Info command (type ``info`` and press Enter). You should see your
DH0 in the list as ``DH0: Not a valid DOS disk``. Now format it with the
command::

    >format DRIVE=DH0: NAME=AROS FFS INTL
    About to format drive DH0:. This will destroy all data on the drive. Are
    you sure ? (y/N)

Enter y, press Enter and wait a second. You should see the string
``Formatting...done`` displayed. If you got an error, use HDToolbox to check
all partition parameters, as you may have missed something, and after saving
and rebooting, repeat.

If you're experiencing problems with format (such as ERROR messages,
especially when using partitions in RDB), though this is unlikely, you can try
the good old  Amiga FORMAT64 utility::

    >extras/aminet/format64 DRIVE DH0: Name AROS FFS INTL


If you enter the Info command again, it should now show::

    >DH0: <size>  <used> <free> <full 0%> <errors> <r/w state> <FFS> <AROS>

That's it. Before the installation, reboot.

.. Note:: If all this seems to be so boring that you can't stand it, there's
          some relief if you intend to use AROS only on a virtual machine.
          First, you can get a pre-installed pack, such as *WinAROS/WinAROS
          Lite* - this system is already installed, though it can be outdated.
          Second, you can look at the `AROS Archives`_ for the *Installation
          Kit*, which contains ready-made virtual HD's that are already
          created and formatted, ready for the installation, so you can skip
          the previous procedure and install a fresh version of AROS.


**Copying the system**

After reboot, you may notice that you can see your AROS HD on the desktop
now, and it's empty. You'll now need to fill it with files.

Now after the Drag 'n' Drop support developed in AROS the whole system can be
easily copied from LiveCD by just dragging files to DH0: drawer. It's only
left to replace the file dh0:boot/grub/menu.lst with
dh0:boot/grub/menu_dh.lst.DH0 then.

There's an installer in AROS, as incomplete as HDToolbox is, but it can
be used. At least, you can try. So, here's the first way to install.

1. Run *InstallAROS* in the Tools drawer. You will see the welcome screen
telling you the same again that you're using the alpha version. Continue
anyway. There's a *Proceed* button for you to click. Next, you will see the
AROS Public License, and you should accept it to go further. Now you will see
the install options window (where it says No, just *uncheck* the relevant
box) ::

    Show Partitioning Options...    []
        <No. As you've done that already>
    Format Partitions               []
        <No. You've done that as well>
    Choose Language Options         []
        <No. It's better to do that later>
    Install AROS Core System        [V]
        <Yes, that's what you're here for>
    Install Extra Software [V]
        <Yes. Uncheck only if you want a lite installation>
    Install Development Software    []
        <No. This is mostly a placeholder at a moment>
    Show Bootloader Options         [V]
        <Yes, bootloader will not be installed otherwise>

Note that *Show Partitioning Options* can be unselectable and greyed out
if the installer is unable to find any suitable partition.

After you've made the selection you want, click *Proceed*.
The next window shows you possible installation destinations::

    Destination Drive
    [default:DH0]

    DH0  <that's correct>

    Use 'Work' Partition                        []
        <uncheck it, you're installing all-on-one>
    Copy Extras and Developer Files to Work?    []
        <uncheck it, as you're not using Work>
    Work drive ... <skipped>

Now after you unchecked those, click *Proceed*. The window showing bootloader
options should appear. Here you can only check whether GRUB, the *GRand
Unified Bootloader*, is to be installed to DH0 and on which device. Click
*Proceed* again.

Now the window says it's ready to install. Click *Proceed* (once again).

After that, the copying progress bar will appear as files are copied. Wait
until after a while the process finishes. After that, you will get the
finishing screen and a *Reboot* checkbox. Leave this checked and click
Proceed. Now your machine will reboot with the same settings as before, from
the Live CD. You're almost there!


**Installing the bootloader**

You should again see your AROS disk, and all files should be there. Since
you've already installed the bootloader in previous steps, nothing should be
missing.

Well, if you used a fresh nightly build then
`GRUB <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRUB>`__ should already be installed and
working, and you can skip the step in the next paragraphs. If not, please
read on.

In older versions (before Nov. 2006) there was a bug in GRUB, preventing it
from installing correctly on the first try. So if you can't boot now, and get
messages like GRUB GRUB FRUB etc., please read the following.
A second try to install it usually helps to solve it. So, now you'll need
InstallAROS once again. Repeat all the previous steps from point 1, but
uncheck every checkbox. After the last click on Proceed, GRUB will be
reinstalled, and a window will appear asking you to confirm that write. Answer
yes as many times as needed. Now, on the last page, uncheck the Reboot
checkbox, close the Install program and power off the machine.

Alternatively, GRUB can be installed from shell with this command::

    c:install-i386-pc device ata.device unit 0 PN <pn> grub dh0:boot/grub kernel dh0:boot/aros-i386.gz

where PN <pn> (or PARTITIONNUMBER <pn>) is the number of partition where GRUB
bootloader will be installed.


**Preparing to boot**
You've now followed your first installation alchemy course, and AROS should
be ready now. Remove the Live CD from the CD drive (or disable booting from
CD in VM) and check it out. You've made it!


**Troubleshooting**
The installation process is one of the topics most frequently asked about on
forums, mostly by newbies. You can check the FAQ to see if there's an answer
to your questions.

Extracting
""""""""""

Simply get the appropriate archives for your platform from the
`download page`_ and extract them where you want them::

    > tar -vxjf AROS-<version>-<platform>-ppc-system.tar.bz2

If you downloaded the contrib archive, you may want to extract it too (but
its contents are already included in the system archive and on the LiveCD)::

    > tar -vxjf AROS-<version>-ppc-all-contrib.tar.bz2

AROS/m68k-backport (AfA)
------------------------

This is not the usual native/hosted flavour of AROS, but a thing that can be
called a *backport*. Actually, it's a set of libraries and binaries to enhance
the capabilities of original AmigaOS. AfA stands for AROS for Amigas.
AfA is developed by Bernd Roesch and can be found
`here <http://amidevcpp.amiga-world.de/afa_binarie_upload.php>`_.




Requirements
""""""""""""

To be written by someone.




Installation
""""""""""""

+ copy the directory AfA_OS_Libs to your sys: Amiga drive Bootpartition.
  If you don't want it there, you can copy it elsewhere and assign AfA_OS:
  to the directory where the AfA_OS_Libs are located.
+ copy Libs:freetype2.library to your sys:libs directory.
+ copy C:AfA_OS_Loader to your sys:fonts directory.
+ copy Fonts: to your sys:fonts directory. If you want to have more fonts,
  use the Fonts from AROS or MOS.
+ copy prefs: to your sys:prefs directory.

To start AfA at boot time, add AfA_OS_Loader to your S:startup-sequence, just
before IPrefs. It must be inserted after patching tools like MCP
or picasso96/cgx, because they patch the AfA_OS Functions back.

If you start it with the parameter MOUSESTART (must be written in uppercase),
you must hold the left mousebutton during boot time to load the modules,
instead of skipping them.

To see if all works well, start the "TextBench" program found in the AfA
archive. Antialiased TTF fonts rendering speed is currently not the best, it
is not optimized (see aatext source code), but hopefully it's fast enough to
be usable even on a 060/50MHz.
