  Short
  -----------------------------------

  Popplaceholder class is a simple but useful class ;) Most applications
  are fully configurable nowadays, offering wide range of various
  parameters for further user modifications.  Not only functions options
  or forms of behaviour are configurable but often most of program
  strings can now be changed by the user.  The latter applies to
  internet (communication) related programs mostly, (e.g.  AmIRC,
  AmTelnet, YAM and so on...) which needs to send various string to
  other different people.  So they allow you to define e.g.  own welcome
  phrase or kick reason sentence.  Because e.g.  your welcome phrase for
  e.g.  John and phrase for Mary will differ only with the name, most of
  these strings uses so called placeholders, to describe varable,
  dynamically modified string part (e.g.  mentioned receipient name).
  For example "On %d, %u wrote:".  The "%d" and "%u" ares just the
  placeholders, program will replace on use by for instance mail date
  and the sender's name (of course placeholder can look like "@name" or
  "%{date}" or "my lovely grandma", but the idea behind remains).

  Unfortunately, most programs forces user to know what placeholder can
  be user where and which means what.  That's kinda user unfriendly
  (especially for beginners, or just-users).  Instead of forcing them to
  type placeholders by hand (in proper syntax!) it would be nicer to let
  them pick up what they want from the list of available items.  That
  both eliminates placeholder syntax problems (unless user 'fix' it
  later by hand of course) as well as disallows to use unsupported
  placeholder (the above exception applies of course).  And here comes
  Popplaceholder class.  It features the ordinary string gadget user can
  type own text in, but it also gives the popup listview, which holds
  all available placeholders.  User can easily select one from the list
  either by double click or by neat Drag&Drop.  See the example demo
  program for better picture of the class' features.

  14.1 (Mon Jul 12 13:09:21 1999)
       - Added MUIA_Poplaceholder_Copy attribute
       - now forwards all list object methods
         to internal pop up list, increasing
         flexibility

  14.2 (Tue Jul 13 19:35:58 1999)
       - shortened all these "MUIx_Popplaceholder_#?"
         to "MUIx_Popph_#?" for easier programming ;)
       - added Drag&Drop feature

  14.3 (Wed Jul 14 14:05:34 1999)
       - first public release
       - wrote autodocs
       - added support for existing string gadget
         replacements (the fallback scheme looks like:
         Textinput -> Betterstring -> original String)
       - MUIA_Popph_StringMaxLen is gettable now

  14.4 (oops, I forgot the datestamp)
       - added support for popup menu when Textinput
         subclass is used
       - added MUIA_Popph_ReplaceMode attribute

  14.5 (Sun Jul 25 19:58:25 1999)
       - Popplaceholder is now 2-in-1 custom class
         (poplaceholderstr.mcc is now useless and
         should be wiped out of your disks)
       - added some internal checks to avoid possible
         problems with tag/descriptions being longer
         than predefined max length
       - Popph object is no longer higher than highest
         object it uses
       - MUIA_Popph_StringType added
       - all TI/BS/String attrubutes are now forwarded
         to internal string object on OM_SET/OM_GET.
         Just talk to Popph as to string gadget
       - added PopAsl alike work mode

  14.6 (Tue Jul 27 16:09:44 1999)

       - public release

  15.0 (Sat Nov 06 17:32:28 1999)
       - now handles the entry even it's incorrect (e.g.
         plain string, w/o separators etc) for easier
         debugging (and wider usage ;-)
       - added MUIA_Popph_PopCycleChain attribute on
         mouse lovers' request (reported by Grzegorz Kraszewski)
       - PopPH now correctly handles ASLFR_DrawersOnly, TRUE
         case in ASL mode (reported by Troels Walsted Hansen)
       - added MUIA_Popph_Title for easy popup list titles

       - fixed MUIA_Popph_Avoid not working correctly
         (Mike Carter)
       - pop buttons removed from the cycle chain
         (MUIA_Popph_PopCycleChain is now FALSE by default)
         as MUI offers special hotkey (CTRL-P by default)
         for that, and won't break the AdvanceOnCR adventages
         (reported by Grzegorz Kraszewski)

       - attached popup listview to the string object, to

         by Mike Carter)
       - now uses all string/list related tags given at
         Popph creation time while creating internal string
         nd list object, to allow use of {I..} attributes
         as well (Carlos) (reported by Mike Carter)

  15.3 (Wed Feb 02 22:53:00 2000) - sponsored by The Hun
